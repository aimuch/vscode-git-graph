# Extension Settings

Every Git Graph setting is described in the Visual Studio Code Settings Editor (search for `@ext:aimdev.git-graph`), and summarised in the [README](../README.md#extension-settings). This page documents the settings that need more explanation than fits in a description.

## Context Menu Actions Visibility

`git-graph.contextMenuActionsVisibility` customises which actions are displayed on Git Graph's context menus. It's an object keyed by context menu, each containing the actions to show (`true`) or hide (`false`). Actions that aren't specified are visible.

For example, to hide "Rebase current branch on Branch..." from the branch context menu, and "Drop..." from the commit context menu:

```json
"git-graph.contextMenuActionsVisibility": {
	"branch": {
		"rebase": false
	},
	"commit": {
		"drop": false
	}
}
```

The context menus, and the key of each of their actions:

## Max Depth of Repo Search

`git-graph.maxDepthOfRepoSearch` (default: `0`) is how many levels of subfolders Git Graph searches when it discovers the repositories in the workspace:

* `0`: Only the workspace folders themselves (and the repository that contains each of them).
* `1`: The workspace folders, and their immediate subfolders.
* `2` or more: Each further level of subfolders.

Searching stops at the first repository found on each path, so repositories nested inside another repository (other than submodules) aren't discovered. They can be added with the command "Git Graph: Add Git Repository...". Larger values make the search slower in workspaces with many folders. Changing the setting triggers a new search.

## Custom Pull Request Providers

The "Pull Request Creation" integration (configured in the Repository Settings of the Git Graph View) opens a pre-filled Pull Request form from a branch's context menu. Bitbucket, GitHub & GitLab are built-in. Other providers (e.g. a self-hosted Gitea or Azure DevOps Server) are added with `git-graph.customPullRequestProviders`, an array of providers, each with:

* `name`: A unique display name, which is listed as a provider in the Repository Settings.
* `templateUrl`: The URL that creates a Pull Request, containing the variables below.

| Variable | Value | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `$1` | Host Root URL | `https://git.example.com` |
| `$2` | Source Owner | `alice` |
| `$3` | Source Repo | `project` |
| `$4` | Source Branch | `feature/login` |
| `$5` | Destination Owner | `team` |
| `$6` | Destination Repo | `project` |
| `$7` | Destination Project ID (GitLab) | `123` |
| `$8` | Destination Branch | `main` |

The values are prefilled from the repository's remotes when the integration is configured, and can be edited there.

For example, a self-hosted Gitea server (which uses the same compare URL as GitHub):

```json
"git-graph.customPullRequestProviders": [
	{
		"name": "Gitea",
		"templateUrl": "$1/$5/$6/compare/$8...$2:$4"
	}
]
```

For reference, the built-in providers use these template URLs:

| Provider | Template URL |
|---|---|
| Bitbucket | `$1/$2/$3/pull-requests/new?source=$2/$3::$4&dest=$5/$6::$8` |
| GitHub | `$1/$5/$6/compare/$8...$2:$4` |
| GitLab | `$1/$2/$3/-/merge_requests/new?merge_request[source_branch]=$4&merge_request[target_branch]=$8&merge_request[target_project_id]=$7` (the project ID parameter is only included when a Destination Project ID is configured) |
